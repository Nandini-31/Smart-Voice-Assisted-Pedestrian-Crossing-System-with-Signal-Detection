# 🚦 Smart Voice-Assisted Pedestrian Crossing System with Signal Detection

## 📌 Overview
This project presents the design and implementation of a **smart pedestrian crossing system** using an **ESP32 microcontroller, ultrasonic sensors, servo motor, and IoT integration (Blynk App)**.  
The system ensures **safe crossing for pedestrians**, particularly the elderly and differently-abled, by automatically managing crossing barriers and providing **voice-assisted guidance**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Improve **safety and accessibility** at pedestrian crossings.  
- Provide **real-time signal detection** with voice assistance.  
- Enable **automatic platform movement** using microcontrollers and sensors.  
- Support **IoT-based remote monitoring** via Blynk.

## 🛠️ Hardware Components
- ESP32 Module  
- Servo Motor  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- LM2596 DC-DC Converter  
- Voice Playback Module (ISD1820)  
- Speaker

## 💻 Software Tools
- Arduino IDE  
- Blynk IoT App  

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. Sensors detect the presence of trains or pedestrians.  
2. ESP32 processes signals and controls the servo motor to **open/close the crossing platform**.  
3. A **voice module + speaker** provides real-time guidance.  
4. IoT integration with **Blynk App** allows remote monitoring and notifications.
